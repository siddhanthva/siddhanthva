👨‍💻 I'm **Siddhanth Veeranna Arkasali**, a passionate **Data Science graduate student at the University of Houston**, driven by curiosity and creativity to turn data into meaningful insights. I’m deeply interested in **machine learning, data visualization, and AI-driven problem-solving**.

🔭 I’m currently working on building **data science projects** focused on predictive analytics, EDA, and machine learning applications. Exploring ways to apply **AI in manufacturing, and business analytics**.

🌱 I’m currently learning:
- Advanced **Machine Learning** and **Deep Learning** techniques.  
- Data engineering tools like **SQL**, **Power BI**, and **Cloud Platforms (AWS, GCP)**.  
- Enhancing my **Python** and **R** programming skills for data-driven research.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on:
- Open-source **data science** or **AI** projects.  
- Research work that uses **data for social or business impact**.  
- Projects that bridge **data science with real-world applications**.

🤔 I’m looking for help with:
- Improving project structure and model deployment using **MLOps**.  
- Guidance on contributing effectively to **open-source repositories**.

💬 Ask me about:
- Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Data Visualization.  
- Machine Learning fundamentals and practical implementation.  
- How to start with **Data Science projects** as a beginner.
